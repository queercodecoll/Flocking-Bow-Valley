(Stoney Nakoda, He/Him)[1/5]
0000:I'm part of the Stoney Nakoda First Nation. I speak Tsuu, we 
0005:are part of Tsuu Nation and I speak Tsuu fluently, and 
0010:I'm a two-spirit male and I've 
0015:been, I grew up in a generation where the two-spirit community was not 
0020:fully engaged or recognized within the community or even 
0025:with the whole in Canada. I think 
0030:it was struggling back in the 70s and 80s. The LGBT community 
0035:coming forward 2001 to the present day, I've seen a lot of changes 
0040:that are more young people coming out, more people staying and people staying together 
0045:as a couple. But the community, 
0050:our membership code has not changed. And I don't think 
0055:that it will change overnight, but it's something 
0100:that we're working on, and I hope that the community will see the two-spirit community 
0105:as a people because we are still part of this nation. We still have membership 
0110:here and we like to be included in that membership and see equality within 
0115:the membership of the Stoney Nakoda Nation which would include two-spirit 
0120:people to be recognized as a family, as a couple, even with their children in 
0125:marriage. So, that's what I'd like to see with 
0130:the Stoney Nakoda Nation, where I'm from. And I've 
0135:been advocating for young people and people in the community.
