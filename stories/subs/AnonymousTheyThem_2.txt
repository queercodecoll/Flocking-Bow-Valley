(They/Them) [2/6]
0000: I mean, my parents only started like using my chosen name literally, probably about a year
0008:ago, and I changed it like way before that. I don't think... It was kind of a shame I would
0015:have liked them to have been part of the process. And when I put the idea forward,
0020:that like my birth name wasn't vibing with me anymore, they laughed it off. Which kind of,
0028:I don't know, I never really share a lot of stuff with them anyway, but it was like it
0031:had taken a big, a big leap to even like come out with this thing like, Oh, I really want
0037:to change my name. And it was met with such kind of derision that I was like, OK, we're
0042:not talking about this anymore. And then I kind of moved to university and was like, OK,
0047:cool, this is my name now. And I'm just never going to invite my parents over, and they're
0052:never going to meet my friends because I don't want anyone to know that. I don't want
0055:anyone to know my dead name. So I guess they just don't get to be part of my life anymore.
0059:And like, they really weren't for like a long time. Yeah, they didn't meet any partners or
0064:friends or anything because I was just so worried that they would just come in and just
0068:be like using this name that I had really taken great pains to not be associated with
0075:anymore. So in that way, they missed out a lot.
0079:And, uh, I changed, I did the whole legal name change thing. And then it wasn't until
0085:like they got posts at the house that it was like, "Oh, this is a real thing. They've like
0089:changed their name." And then it was like, then they started using it because that was
0093:like official in their eyes, you know, and it was like, "Oh, now it's legitimate." But
0097:you've kind of missed out, you missed the whole process, you missed the part where you
0100:could have had input about what I was called. You had, you know? So that's very sad for
0106:them, I guess. I don't think they really realized what they've really missed out on.
0110:Same with some of my siblings. Some were a bit better than others. Yeah. Having a small
0116:niece in the family kind of helps because she's like, "You're getting [name redacted]
0123:name wrong. You're not saying it right!" And I'm like, Yeah, right. You know. This is all
0128:I've ever been to you. So, having a little kid around who just kind of like cuts through
0133:the bulls-- has also been quite a nice, a nice asset in my favor so that's been like quite cute.
