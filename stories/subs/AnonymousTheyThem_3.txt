0000:My therapist thinks I should try and unpack a bit more of the anxiety around people knowing
0006:my dead name, but she is cis and doesn't really get that it's just such a big lack of
0011:control. I think when people know that thing about you because you don't know how people
0015:react to that and you don't know how people will be like, Oh, well, their name is really
0019:xxx. And then it's like, you know, they never go back to seeing you in the way that you
0024:want to be seen. And that is super important to me, and I know that there are people who
0030:like, are quite public about their dead names and their transition and stuff. I guess
0037:another part of the reason I don't really think I have a story is just, I really keep a
0041:lot of that thing like low-key. Like, a lot of my friends don't even know that I have, 
0046:don't have a, you know, I don't use my birth name, my dead name or whatever, and I'm quite
0050:happy with that. Because, yeah, again, it's kind of just a big part of the control of the
0057:way that I present myself to the world and the way that people see me. Which is kind of
0063:a shame in ways. I feel like I miss out on the trans experience by not being massively
0068:open about it, and it's that whole thing of like, Oh, am I really like trans? Am I really
0072:non-binary if I'm not like being so open about all this stuff? Yeah.
0079:I kind of lost a bunch of connections with my old friends and stuff as well because of it
0084:again, the whole thing of just like feeling too awkward to talk about it and like, what 
0088:will they think... They'll think I'm being weird or extra. Like if they don't want to
0092:take it on board and stuff, which was again, like a big loss in that it was kind of just
0097:like, there's a very much like pre-name-change me and post-name-change me.
0102:And that kind of like my, there was a point where my life was kind of cleaved in half,
0105:and I've regained some of those connections since and kind of managed to bring it up. But
0111:I mean, this is like the better part of a decade later, and it really has taken a lot
0115:of courage and getting away from the anxiety about that. So there's a kind of there's a
0122:sense of loss there and a sense of, just, disconnectedness that's kind of hard to
0129:reconcile with anything, you know. 
0133:There's no other way that I could see that it would have worked out, but yeah, just wish
0138:I'd had the capacity to be maybe a little bit braver about it. It feels like a
0143:non-experience, but that in itself makes it an experience. Like it's a quiet one, but
0148:it's still very valid and obviously a thing that's taken up a lot of my emotional space
0153:over the years.
