0000:I guess, it's just hard to get people to wrap around you know, 
0005:like gay people. They already struggle with being accepted 
0010:or there's still a challenge from the Community being accepted 
0015:as a gay person and then there's another spectrum 
0020:of bisexuality, which is another thing that people just think that bisexuals 
0025:are just in a phase or just a period of confusion 
0030:or whatnot. It's hard like when people don't understand 
0035:that I'm not gay. Nothing against gay, but I'm 
0040:not gay. I do get attracted to both genders, male 
0045:and female. But yeah like in most conversations, 
0050:even with friends and family like you know they just don't 
0055:get it. They would just say that you know, I'd find a guy. It's 
0060:always directing towards a guy. Because they think that I'm 
0065:attracted to guys only. It's like, you're not straight, therefore 
0070:you're only attracted to the same gender. So that's 
0075:been a battle almost every day that I go through.
