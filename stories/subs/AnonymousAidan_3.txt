0000:As an Asian male, 
0005:I've really been part of this systematic racism, where Asian males are thought of 
0010:as less masculine. I guess in Western cultures, it’s about, you 
0015:know, getting big muscles, like the Hollywood influence, like tough, very stoic 
0020:male. As the Asian male, generally, they are, like, just 
0025:simple or don't really work out in the gym. These are the 
0030:stereotypes. So I also experienced that because whenever I go on dating apps, 
0035:I didn't get any response. And I don't think there's anything wrong with my profile. 
0040:Like, comparing myself to another male white person who would get results. But 
0045:for me, like zero. Nothing. And sometimes I would get 
0050:blocked for no reason. Especially on Grindr if I go there. If I put a picture 
0055:of me, I wouldn't get a response at all. If I take my picture off, 
0060:people would be messaging me asking me for my photos. And 
0065:I wouldn't put my race on my profile. I put it blank. As soon as it says 
0070:Asian, I won't get a response unless it's someone who just really has 
0075:a strong fetish for Asians, which is rare. But yeah, like on 
0080:Grindr, as soon as I send my picture, instant block. 
0085:Not even a word. Just instant block. And I've traveled to other places 
0090:and I get instantly blocked and I think I'm not an ugly person, I'm 
0095:very fit, healthy, I exercise, I take care of myself, I get my haircuts 
0100:regularly, I keep my teeth clean, I go to the dentist regularly, 
0105:and I think I'm a... you know I'm not probably 
0110:a supermodel, but I think I'm not that ugly. But you know, 
0115:like people just block me right away, without any words. It's 
0120:like, why? Like what's wrong? And it's just really frustrating. 
0125:And it's a very toxic environment, Grindr. But it just reflects 
0130:like how our society is, you know. Asians are probably like seen 
0135:as the lowest in masculinity and as a bisexual male…, it’s 
0140:just frustrating.
