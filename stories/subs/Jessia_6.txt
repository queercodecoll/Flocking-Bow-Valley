0000:I have a lot of difficulty like qualifying my career experience because like I 
0005:think for a lot of people, especially if they see me out and about, depending 
0010:on what time of my life they caught me at, like I'm fairly masc presenting like 
0015:I don't like, I don't experience real dysphoria, but my 
0020:body beyond, you know, some eating disorder stuff. But 
0025:yeah, I definitely felt queer 
0030:for a lot of my life, and I felt mostly attracted to women. But yeah, 
0035:no, I felt plainly attracted to men throughout my life, and I was fairly aware 
0040:of it. For me at the time, I thought like, OK, well, I mean, I've got a convenient 
0045:out here. I am a 14 year old kid who already feels kind of outcast because 
0050:both my parents were hard of hearing, you know, my mom was pretty 
0055:critically ill growing up and, you know, 
0060:they didn't really have much of a context for the hearing world. They went to boarding schools run by 
0065:nuns. So I always felt like I was straddling different 
0070:social worlds to begin with. So the idea of adding more complication 
0075:to that by educating myself as a queer, bisexual, whatever, 
0080:when I saw other people who did that get antagonized or, you know, just make their 
0085:lives more difficult. I, you know, I just I stuck 
0090:behind, you know, had a pretty nonstandard gender presentation. And I always, you 
0095:know, I leaned pretty hard into the emo and scene thing because that 
0100:was a convenient place for people who wanted to play with their appearance 
0105:or have a bit more fun with fashion. And that's where a lot of the queer 
0110:kids right now, frankly, like I think what animated a lot of 
0115:what's come to characterize my coming to be from 
0120:13 onwards was kind of a conscious need for resistance. And, I, yeah. 
0120:I don't know where I would be without my understanding of a 
0135:need to resist things that are right and that broadly interpreted is. 
0130:Like, I'm glad that's animated me in retrospect, I don't 
0145:think that's a rewarding process for everybody, but I'm glad it was for me 
0140:because it feels like some pretty good 21st century preparation. 
0155:We're going to need our fair share of rebellion going forward. So happy to bring it in spades.
