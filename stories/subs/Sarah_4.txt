0000:Something that my parents talked about with me just recently, actually, because I've obviously been telling them about organizing
0005:Canmore pride and, and everything and my  
0010:dad basically told me he's like, you know, mom and I did talk about you being 
0015:gay when you were younger. It's like you never told me this. Cuz like, like it crossed 
0020:my mind. And he's like, did you 
0025:know before beforehand? I'm like, yeah, of course. I definitely thought about it and considered it, and I was like, Well. 
0030:And I didn't want to admit it, because this is still a friend that I have to this day, and I 
0035:almost feel embarrassed if she would ever find out, but I 100 percent had sexual feelings towards 
0040:her. And when I guess we kind of drifted apart a little bit, 
0045:that hit me a lot harder than it should have for any friendship to be lost. I 
0050:never thought about it, but just sitting down and thinking about everything 
0055:over the last month or two, it's definitely made me realize why 
0060:it hit me so hard, even though I wanted to deny it at the time when I had those feelings. 
0065:It was really hurtful and I ended up actually, being like, 
0070:very depressed for a few months, we're talking like really bad panic and anxiety 
0075:attacks and ended up being on medication. I was 
0080:self-harming at the time as well and my parents found out 
0085:and obviously, there was a lot to unravel when that happened, 
0090:and I think that was part of it, was realizing that I might have been 
0095:gay. And then you're going to like a counselor when I was sent to  
0100:a counselor from my parents, it was a church counselor, so it wasn't like I 
0105:could talk to them about this kind of stuff. But the reason why I think it had also gone 
0110:really bad as well was because when I was younger, I was sexually assaulted 
0115:by someone in the church. It was an older male, and I 
0120:guess the main focus of my depression was on that. It was never the fact that I might also be 
0125:questioning my queer identity at the same time. That obviously came up like later as well. But 
0130:for me as well, it kind of upset my parents that they knew about it because when I did come out to them, 
0135:another comment that was made from my dad, it was like, Well, do you think this is because what happened 
0140:when you were younger? And I'm like, yeah, maybe it partly is. Maybe I did not trust men for 
0145:a very long time, and maybe I did trust women a lot more and wanted to get closer 
0150:to a woman because I wanted to be, you know, so far away from that gender. But I don't hate men like I 
0155:still love men and I find men attractive, you know, as I was growing up, but I 
0160:also think my queerness wasn't just based on that experience. I think there's a lot more to it. It 
0165:was comforting that they had considered it, and 
0170:I guess. For them to process, it might have been a little bit easier 
0175:because it's not like, it didn't cross their minds.
