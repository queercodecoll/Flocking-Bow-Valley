(They/Them) [1/6]
0000:I feel like this is definitely a thing I've been asked before. Obviously, everyone's
0005:like, what's your coming out story? And I always say, I don't really have one. Just
0010:because, I don't know, I feel like I've always just been me and never really had any
0017:like, big revelations.
0019:I also really don't like the whole idea of coming out. I feel like straight people don't
0025:have to sit people down and announce that they're straight. So why should I have to,
0028:you know, do any kind of big announcement or whatever about something that is really just
0034:like... a thing that's just a part of my life that doesn't really have any bearing on
0041:anyone else.
0043:Which I guess goes with sexuality and also like gender as well like. I think as far as
0051:using they/them pronouns go.
0054:I just started using them on Twitter then Facebook, and then people would just be like,
0060:Oh, I see you're using they/them pronouns now and then just kind of started using them, and
0064:I was like, Okay, this works, I don't have to like explain this to anyone. This is fine. I
0070:was pretty lucky in that aspect to be kind of part of a very nice LGBTQ trans
0080:community at university. So.
0084:That wasn't like an out-of-the-ordinary kind of thing in the sport I was playing. Everyone
0089:was kind of aware of that, and like non-binary genders were kind of counted as
0096:part of the sport.
