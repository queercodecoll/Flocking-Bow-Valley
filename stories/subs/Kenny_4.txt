(Stoney Nakoda, He/Him)[4/5]
0000:There was five of us that stood our ground and supported each other, you know, we 
0005:stood up for each other and they realized that in that world, we 
0010:walk the same land as they walk and we live in this world. And 
0015:I think that as adults now, most of them 
0020:are deceased and my friends are still here. Unfortunately, 
0025:we lost one this year, so I was really devastated 
0030:by his death. But the family wanted to put a Pride flag on his coffin. They 
0035:did that, so it was really  
0040:a sad moment. We thought about the encouragement 
0045:that he gave us to give up and never stop expressing yourselves 
0050:was our motto as kids, as teenagers, as adults 
0055:still carry that.
