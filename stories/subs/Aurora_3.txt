0015:kind of, that's gone. But you know, I live in Banff 
0020:too, so we have all the tourists that come around all the time. And I

0030:in, you know, sit down and, you know, listen to the music and chill and whatnot 
0035:and everything's going fine. And then we get to the first hymn, and my 
0040:job in the church is as the only musician is not just to play the

0060:on their necks when because I have an operatically trained bass-baritone and 
0065:you could just like see the snap of like 
0070:which was it was like the best part of every Sunday morning.
