0000:Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I was able to actually enact my queerness 
0005:in the Bow Valley, frankly, and that that funny superpower about 
0010:understanding where to find comfortable niches really came to light in a very fun 
0015:and entertaining way. Frankly, that's also a fun story. But 
0020:yeah, I think having come out like really integrated like all this 
0025:stuff about my identity, like, you know, I tried to, you know, find a fella and 
0030:that was hard. I didn't have the same kind of queer 
0035:context that a lot of other people had. So I was surprised that I didn't. My 
0040:understanding was that, you know, I come out and then I'm part of the LGBTQ community. I can hang out on 
0045:Church Street and do all the fun things. But I realize like, you know, I didn't 
0050:I didn't need that, that community for security in the same way other people 
0055:did. So I didn't really feel that well integrated into it. So when I came to the Bow Valley 
0060:and noticed that like, oh, like, there's not like a really well integrated queer community here, at least there
0065:wasn't. I was like, Well, this is just kind of my experience. I'm still going to seek it out and 
0070:see how it goes. And you know, I had, I had I've had some good experiences with men, 
0075:but I also had like a few that were just shit. And that was 
0080:really painful because I was like, Oh, like, you know, I thought I would find really informed
0085:gay men that were going to, you know, I thought
0090:this was safe and it's totally not. I I'd never really
0095:had to reckon with the problems within the queer community until, you know, trying to be within 
0100:it. You know, I had I had one experience in Toronto that was very difficult where, you know, I 
0105:met up with a guy online. You're going to fool around his car in a parking lot or whatever, you know, pretty standard
0110:like casual encounter, but he just immediately got weird. 
0115:It was super weird, super weird. So I tried to leave and you, like, grab my shirt on the way out of his car 
0120:and like, fortunately, I was, you know, fairly confident 
0125:and took a pretty firm line and got out of it and spent like 
0130:two blocks like hanging out of his window, screaming sorry at me and wouldn't 
0135:leave until I threatened to kick off his side mirrors and a cop drove by. 
0140:Like, That's not the experience I was hoping for trying to, like, find respectable 
0145:queer relationships so that that put a sour taste in my mouth like that was 
0150:a little traumatizing.
