Jessia
(He/They) [3/5]
0000:I went to like a Catholic elementary school, so 
0005:yeah, I had to like, play nice for Jesus, for a lot 
0010:of time at school and in school itself. I mean, I 
0015:felt like, you know, feeling like I had to not necessarily disguise myself or just like, my 
0020:agreeable front in school. And I'd say it's starting elementary school, but to 
0025:dodge some, some Catholicism shit. But like, I just killed it 
0030:at school, like, I just really leaned hard into it. I'm 
0035:not too sure what I was avoiding realistically. Like I think after so long 
0040:doing that, you you get away from the fact that you're trying to hide the fact that you're, you 
0045:know, sometimes attracted to men and feel weird about your gender. Like, that's 
0050:it lends itself to a kind of practicality that forms other parts of your personality without 
0055:you realizing. I think I recognized, you know, I mentioned it felt dishonest, 
0060:and that was like kind of the great moral crisis of my mid-twenties, probably. Whereas 
0065:like, like am I like deceiving people like, is this wrong? I 
0070:think like strangely, my answer out of this was religion.
0075:In university I kind of leaned pretty hard into eastern philosophy and Buddhism 
0080:and my idea of like what the self is.
0085:Like I'm saying, help me justify it. But like, no, like, this is what helped me form 
0090:my understanding of what the world is. And you know, the idea of 
0095:what the self is, my understanding is that it's kind of it's formed by 
0100:everything around you. You're conditioned by so much. So your idea of who you are 
0105:is going to kind of rise and fall and pass away as 
0110:who you encounter and what you're doing and what you're surrounding yourself with, it
0115:changes. And, you know, Buddhism and you know, my understanding of, you 
0120:know, rebirth really helped shape that and settle 
0125:that conflict agreeably. So that was a major turning 
0130:point. Like shortly after coming out to my family, I'd kind of managed to integrate 
0135:all that into something that felt, you know, not just 
0140:livable, but beautiful.
