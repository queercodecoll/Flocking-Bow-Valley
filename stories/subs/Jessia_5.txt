0000:A regretful admission, but I was once considering enlisting in the military, so 
0005:I was like doing a lot of like, I was working out a ton, it like briefly 
0010:became my identity. I was like carrying backpacks with like 90 pounds of sand, like on 
0015:crazy hikes. I don't know. It was ridiculous, but like it was kind of a leaning into 
0020:a kind of masculinity that I'd historically been very critical of. And 
0025:I like noticed it kind of start to like, infiltrate, you know, 
0030:how I thought and I got very like, it made me nauseous, almost like it was strange, like I was the most, I 
0040:was in the best shape of my life. Like, I was like, Damn, I was sexy briefly. And 
0045:you know, it was it was disorienting, though, like all it really took for 
0050:me to be taken more seriously as like a sexy masculine figure 
0055:was 15 pounds of muscle. And that was frustrating because it was like, oh, you 
0065:know, this masculinity that I don't feel very comfortable in, that I've never felt strongly 
0070:attached to that like realistically is like paying dividends, like it's easier 
0075:to get laid. I feel healthy. But like, it almost wasn't 
0080:worth it, it felt that that was the first time I felt any sort of like body  
0085:dysphoria, I guess I was like, Why is? Why, why is 
0090:this working and it didn't feel comfortable to answer? Like, 
0095:it was almost like, I like, yeah, I can I can swallow the toxic 
0100:masculinity pill and suddenly sociability feels like it's, 
0105:you know, almost unfairly easy, like 
0110:people just treat you with authority immediately, people will 
0115:look to you immediately for answers, and I noticed like that in classroom settings too, like, 
0120:you know, you'll say something and then you effectively just 
0125:said what a woman had said ten minutes prior, but you get a thumbs up for 
0130:it. You know, like, I noticed that, but like, yeah, 
0135:I don't know, really steeping myself in it inadvertently while training for the military. 
0140:I think, yeah, that's probably like when I started really like kind of 
0145:being critical of my own masculinity and like what I actually thought of it. Nowadays, 
0150:like, I, you know, I'm comfortable with he/they. I don't really 
0155:care about my gender. I don't know. Like, I don't know 
0160:if gender apathy is. I'm not sure how valid that is, but it feels 
0165:valid. I don't know. I don't really care to be called a man or not. And 
0170:like, you know, you're not going to be able to threaten you with that, like. Saying I'm 
0175:going to be less of a man for doing something just never factored into my decision making, and when it did, 
0180:it was extremely disconcerting. But internally, like, yeah, I don't 
0185:know, I'm a dude, but I don't know. There 
0190:still feels like there's some sort of unsettled conflict, and I don't know 
0195:how to qualify that, but it mostly just gets expressed as a yeah, 
0200:I said apathy, and I'll probably stick with that. Yeah, an apathy towards my own gender.
