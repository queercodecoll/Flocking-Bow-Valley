0000:So, Banff traditionally has had Banff Pride, which has been pretty, pretty good. But 
0005:beyond that, there hasn't been much for queer folks in Bow Valley. And 
0010:like no year-round presence and we're obviously out there, we're obviously out there everywhere. And 
0015:so I just like worked on a bunch of different ways to try to find things. 
0020:And, you know, like any experiments, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. And if it doesn't work like, keep 
0025:going. And then ultimately, so 
0030:this place I've mentioned a couple of times, The Radiant actually has, like really,
0035:truly become kind of the queer hub of 
0040:Banff. Like not a gay bar, but it's just basically always gay. And so they ended up kind 
0045:of creating this place that would finally serve as a hub because that was always the struggle is that it's 
0050:hard to create clear spaces in places that are like 
0055:super cis-het. So that was a great opportunity. And then and then they also 
0060:have a stage in there. And sound tech gear and everything else 
0065:and our and are prepared to be like, "Somebody wants to go up and do a thing, can we do that?" Yeah, sure. 
0070:Here we go. Right. So they had the equipment and the space, and I had the idea and 
0075:we just like made it happen. And 
0080:that and other things have really started to create a clear space in Bow Valley, which has been really 
0085:amazing because I mean, I guess it's kind of also what this whole project is about is what's 
0090:the benefit of, you know, these communities 
0095:have, you know, a lot of identities and lifestyles 
0100:that are traditionally marginalized and, you know, so like we actually have a Facebook 
0105:group now for Bow Valley Queers to be part of. And it's become a 
0110:place that people feel safe enough being like, hey, I've 
0115:got an hour to kill at the coffee shop. Come join me. All right. So, this is like 
0120:the community creation has started to create spontaneous community creation. All 
0125:right, which is so nice to have. And we just didn't 
0130:have before, but it's been a long, a long like adventure for not just 
0135:me, but for the other folks that were also trying to do this of trial and error, trial and error, trial and error, trial and 
0140:error. And it's kind of strange that it was the pandemic that finally got everything that we finally captured 
0145:what we were looking for.
