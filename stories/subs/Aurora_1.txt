0000:I stream on Twitch, and today was the first day that we were, I would say, rightfully 
0005:fearful that something would happen, and I don't know if you follow this kind of news at 
0010:all. But there are actual Nazis doing actual what's called hate 
0015:raids on Twitch right now and like roving gangs 
0020:of actual Nazis, will show up in queer, 
0025:and by queer I mostly mean trans women streams, and POC 
0030:streams and say exactly the kinds of things that you would think Nazis would say 
0035:to them. They spam chat so hard. And spam, like 
0040:the Discord channel and the Instagram link and you know, any linked social media site from it, so hard with 
0045:Nazi garbage. And when I say Nazis, I'm not exaggerating, like they're literally 
0050:using swastikas as their little icons for who they are. And so 
0055:we figured out it was going to happen. So I've seen what they're saying and it's like, can I? Can I use 
0060:some triggering language for a second? So. What 
0065:they do is they do things is they come into your stream and they do things that are free, 
0070:but then cause like a big splash to go up on the screen. 
0075:And so it says something like "All tranies are men" ends up on the screen really big. 
0080:And it's like, Yeah, amazing. I don't have ovaries. 
0085:You sure got me. You got me, Mr. Nazi, you did it. Right, like, it's boring. 
0090:I'm actually much more worried about other 
0095:folks in chat who maybe haven't been out for as long as I 
0100:have that haven't gotten to the point where it's boring. And so you got to turn all that off and then what you got to do 
0105:is now you got to recover from it. Because there's people that were watching your stream. Right,
0110:now you got to kind of come together. And it's and it's really fortunate that the
0115:Cities Skylines community, which is that city building game that I play, is really, really
0120:good. You know, and really, really, really
0125:wonderful and really affirming and really inclusive, and so everybody
0130:is kind of aware tangentially that this will happen from time to time right now, unfortunately. It
0135:sucks, right? Because it's, you know, it takes something that you like
0140:and enjoy and is positive, and then adds this to it, and I guess it's kind of neat for this story
0145:too because it's an example of... You know, a lot of the people in the city's community
0150:aren't queer, a lot of them are. But everybody is kind of there with it and everybody is
0155:really supportive. Like, god, I think everybody probably has a rainbow emoji somewhere in there in
0160:their thing, and that's a choice. I don't want to get too much into it, but that's a very deliberate choice. It's very hard to
0165:pinkwash your twitch stream. Like, you, that was a series of choices
0170:that led them to have that. So it's like it comes together. But also it's like, come on, Nazis. Like, be better.
