0000:One experience was my partner and I were walking to work along the street, 
0005:along the road there and a guy, put his window down and literally yelled out your 
0010:f'ing gay and I'm like "cool". I think we're very aware of that. That's 
0015:why we're holding hands in public. Yeah. You know, the little things like that, it's 
0020:harder. Even like once or twice we'd go out like, I worked at a restaurant there with 
0025:like a late night bar afterwards, and you'd go there and you have guys hitting on 
0030:you and you'd say, Oh, like, this is actually my partner. We're together. We're not interested. And 
0035:they're like, "Oh no, that's totally cool. You know, like my sisters or cousins, gay and blah blah blah". And it's
0040:a nice conversation. And half an hour later, they're proposing, you know, a threesome. That's 
0045:definitely my most annoying. You're not supportive. You're 
0050:just seeing this as an opportunity.
