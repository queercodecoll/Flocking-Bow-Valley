0000:My sister, actually, so when I ended up coming
0005:out, I had contacted my sister, I'm the youngest of four, and I said,
0010:"Hey, there's something that's been weighing for a long time. I just wanted to have a conversation." She's
0015:like "Something weighing on me as well." I'm like, "OK, Should I go
0020:first? Or you go first?" And she's like, "I think, you know, I think I know what you're going to tell me." But I'm like, OK.
0025:She's like, "Are you coming out to me?" I'm like, "Yeah." So when I can
0030:out to her, it was like, "I'm not really too concerned about coming out to you, but I need you to
0035:help me come out to mom and dad." So then she's
0040:like, "How do you want to do this? Do you want to plan it?" And at the time I'm like, "I'm just so anxious right now. Like, I just
0045:wanted to get it over with like, I can't just sit on this for any longer. And I feel like it's something
0050:that I realize that has made me so happy. And I just want to tell everyone at this point, I'm not
0055:nervous or scared. I'm just happy, and people need to know that I finally found
0060:myself in a way, I guess." And my sister is like, "OK, well,
0065:I'll drive over to Mom's right now where you can do it." And I ended up coming out, and obviously, it was like an
0070:hour or two, maybe two hours of talking back and forth. And there was some, really, it was lots of tears. It
0075:was some good statements made, there was some bad statements made. We
0080:end up dealing with that. So only recently we still talk about, you know, some
0085:comments that were made that I explained to my mom were harmful and she's like, "I didn't say that."
0090:Yeah, you did. But the fact that they've come so far
0095:and I am proud of them and something that I've had to also realize. For
0100:them is that it wasn't anger, it was they didn't grow up in the same
0105:world that we did where there's education available at their fingertips. My
0110:mom grew up being told that if you were queer, you had to hide it.
0115:It was something that you hide. You don't talk about. You don't share. And so
0120:for her to then educate and almost have a similar mindset to me now, we
0125:accept everyone no matter what and love is love, is something to applaud.
0130:And even though some comments were made earlier that were harmful. She's
0135:come a long way. They both have come a long way, and I really respect that.
