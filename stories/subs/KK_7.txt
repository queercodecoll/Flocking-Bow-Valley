(They/Them) [7/8]
0000:It is tiring to be misgendered and to feel unsafe or feel uncertain of like, 
0005:why is that person looking at me? And why, why are they still looking 
0010:at me? You know? And so when you have queer spaces, you can just simply. Exist 
0015:and be, and that is just such a 
0020:relief as a queer person, and it feels so good and it's validating, but I think sometimes it's just 
0025:like I can just breathe in this space. And 
0030:I don't have to look behind me or wonder if it's OK or worry about if 
0035:someone's going to bother me in the washroom or whatever it is, it's just. And 
0040:I think maybe people have like an idea of like all queer spaces are like extremely 
0045:radical and we're like always fighting for something in reverence, like we just 
0050:wanted to hang out. And be left alone like. 
0055:We're like you in that way, but you just get left alone 
0060:so you can go anywhere and just be, you know, no one's bothering you. And 
0065:it's like so interesting. We're like, well, why do you need queer spaces? It's 
0070:like because every space is a straight space.
