0000:So when I came to Canada, I kind of told 
0005:my parents that I wasn't interested in the church already and it 
0010:kind of came out that they were already looking into it for a year or so, which 
0015:was really good. Obviously, the fact that we're all on the same page 
0020:was helpful. And then when I came out to my parents, it was definitely hard. 
0025:I think it would've taken I mean, I'd say. Let's 
0030:say two years. I mean, within three months, there was massive leaps. 
0035:But then it took, I think, two years for at least my mom to fully understand 
0040:and wrap her head around it, right? Or just not to accept me, but to accept everyone in the community. You 
0045:know, it's one thing, and I remember her almost... I remember one conversation 
0050:where it was like, Oh, like, it's a bit easy to accept lesbians as opposed to gay people. I'm like, Why is that?
0055:*laughs* Like, it's just interesting comments that I think is like, 
0060:ingrained in my mom's upbringing as well, and just the church, 
0065:basically, in my opinion, brainwashing them. I think my mom's perspective was 
0070:hearing about the gay community that was always gay men in nightclubs, and 
0075:they're sleeping with everyone. And I'm like, that's, women can do that as well. Like the whole point of 
0080:queer isn't like that we're promiscuous or anything like that or trying to explain that to 
0085:my mom was difficult. And it's OK. Just like someone could have multiple partners 
0090:in their life. It's okay for someone who is homosexual to also have multiple partners.
