0000:I don't know to what extent my name factored into this, this is like a private 
0005:conspiracy theory because of a name like mine. You get misgendered 
0010:or people just don't really know how to interpret, they'll look around you in 
0015:the classroom, but they actually don't know where to start. But it also meant that people didn't know how to gender me at 
0020:first and I'd get misgendered. It was something that was happening to a lot of other scenesters
0025:who were queer, questioning or gay or whatever.
0030:Yeah, people would just, "you're weird",
0035:I'm just going to make bland assumptions about your gender or your social values or where
0040:you're coming from, you know, like, I don't know. It's fairly typical, just
0045:crappy reads of people not informed by the later days of the
0050:queer liberation movement. Those were some weird boundary times. It's
0055:legal to get married, but I mean, some
0060:social facts hadn't really caught up to people. Especially for my trans friends.
0065:That was pretty difficult. And, you know, I still have people to this day
0070:that kind of just vanished, you know, they didn't have it easy at home. You know, they weren't
0075:going to find acceptance at school or in their neighborhoods or anywhere else. So they just
0080:ran off. And, you know, I didn't hear from them again. So
0085:I knew that like what I was experiencing, you know, it was just not on the level as other people.
0090:So I was happy to be a loud ally and somebody
0095:constantly denying they were, probably what
0100:would appear to be pretty paper-thin defenses in hindsight
0105:to those people now that I'm a bit more public about it.
