0000:Two-spirited people in the early years of beyond the eighteen hundreds were 
0005:considered medicine people. Visionaries and they were respected. So 
0010:after the 19th century, I think we  
0015:kind of, seems like we kind of got into the dark ages where it was condemned. It was, 
0020:you know, just because Christians say that it's this way, then 
0025:people in that community saw it that way. You know, it was just one voice, 
0030:and then that's what they believe. And of course, there was a ripple effect and some 
0035:people didn't know how to express themselves because we were being robbed of our identity as indigenous 
0040:people. Assimilation, and intergenerational 
0045:trauma. But, you know, I had cousins that 
0050:are older than me also that grew up in the sixties, in the 70s. 
0055:There's some of them are still alive. And so throughout 
0060:all these years, you know, those stood quiet. And, but you know, me going 
0065:to school in the 80s, I just, you know, I got ridiculed, 
0070:I got bullied. But I still expressed myself openly 
0075:with a few of my friends, two-spirit friends. We, we did find, you know, we 
0080:still told each other as friends that we weren't meant to stop us 
0085:from being who we are. You know, we're part of this community too. We have every 
0090:right to express ourselves. And we did. You know, they would call us any names and all 
0095:that. Still, we expressed ourselves as who we are and  
0100:as two-spirit people. So we share what we went through the struggles, the 
0105:name calling and all the emotional pain that we went through. We 
0110:survived in a sense, I guess.
