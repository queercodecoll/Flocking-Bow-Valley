(They/Them) [8/8]
0000:This summer, I went out to wine country around 
0005:Kelowna with some friends, and we were going to different wineries and doing wine tastings, 
0010:and throughout one of the tastings, I had to go to the washroom 
0015:and there was an assumedly straight, middle-aged 
0020:blond white woman who was there waiting. And there were two private stalls. I asked her, Are you going 
0025:to go ahead? Is there someone in that washroom? And she was like, Oh, well. No, 
0030:but that's the men's. And I asked her again, well, it's a private stall. 
0035:She says yes, but that's the men's, like. Ok, I'm 
0040:going to go in there then and I go into the washroom. And 
0045:I'm just, whatever. So I'm sitting on the toilet and I hear some man 
0050:come up to her and be like, Is there someone in there? I can sound - she's kind of like a bit distressed 
0055:even. She's still waiting. She probably has to pee very badly, you know? And 
0060:she's like, Well, well, there's there's there's just a little fella in there. 
0065:I'm like. Who's the little fella? I'm 
0070:like washing my hands and I'm like, Oh, I'm the little fella. 
0075:And it's like her concept of gender is so binary that she 
0080:was distraught to go into the men's washroom despite being a cis person that 
0085:she couldn't even conceive, that well. I'm 
0090:a man or I'm a woman, and I'm going to go to the washroom that's according so, because I 
0095:went into the men's and I was wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt. I was a little fella.
