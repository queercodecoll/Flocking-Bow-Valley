0000:It's been tough to find community and I 
0005:just usually connect with the arts community or music. Just 
0010:before sharing my stories here, I responded 
0015:to artwork on Facebook about being in a community, and said, 
0020:“Thanks for sharing this picture. I'm really happy 
0025:because it makes me feel passionate about communities.” And 
0030:then someone responded, "Enough of your refugee 
0035:crap.” I have to deal with this every freaking 
0040:day. I think I’m a very smart person. 
0045:I'm Artistic. I'm not, you know, I'm not a crappy 
0050:person, I know that. Yet I'm still living 
0055:with less opportunities, and I see these people 
0060:just wasting their time. Even though they 
0065:have all these opportunities to grow. Already 
0070:I have too many things happening in my life 
0075:and it's draining. I can't be my full potential. Like 
0080:till now I'm still poor, I'm 
0085:still unable to… to really do things that I 
0090:really wanted to do because of all these challenges, and all 
0095:these stereotypes. Like, they hear my 
0100:accent and I'm already perceived as unintelligent or you 
0105:know, they hear my accent and they think 
0110:that I'm lesser than them. Although I'm 
0115:a smart person. I'm intelligent. But 
0120:yeah those were shadowed by my color, my accent, 
0125:my sexuality. I deserve better but, 
0130:this is the way the community and society is going.
