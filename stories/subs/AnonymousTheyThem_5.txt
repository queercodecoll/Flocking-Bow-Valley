0000:There are so many things that are so pointlessly gendered. I think a lot of it for
0004:me as well is I want people to just not make assumptions about me. Just in general, and I
0012:mean, I'm sure some of that is misogyny, you know, I don't want people to make assumptions
0016:about me at work based on the very male industry that I work in and that kind of
0023:thing as well. You know, I just... I just wish I had a bit more control over how people
0030:see me. And yeah, there's just so many pointlessly gendered things, and it just
0035:makes me feel very tired. Just a bone-deep exhaustion of why it has to be this way is so
0042:dumb, it's so frustrating. I have my nice bubble of like my university friends and my
0048:like trans and non-binary and like queer crowd who I'm happy with. But for the most
0054:part, I just don't really reveal a lot of this stuff to the people around me, which,
0060:again, makes day-to-day, a little frustrating, sometimes. It's just like, I'm
0064:here for a summer job, like, is it really worth having my colleagues look at me and
0068:think, "Oh my God, I don't want to interact with that person because I'm worried that I'm
0071:going to get their pronouns wrong, and that it's going to be a whole thing. And then, you
0074:know, it's just like, it's just this exhausting wave of like choosing who gets to
0078:see me, actually, and who I'm kind of just putting up a bit of a facade with.
0086:Yeah, and then.
0089:And if you don't say it straight away and then you become friends with someone later
0093:and then they're like, Oh my God, I've been getting wrong this entire time and says, Oh
0096:my god, oh my God. It's just like, Just don't make a big deal out of it. Just like, let it
0100:be a thing that I've now decided to tell you about and don't be weird about it. And even
0107:the progressive people can be as well sometimes like the people who you think get
0111:it. There's always that risk of like putting your faith in the wrong person and then they
0115:mess it up, and then you just feel like, Oh, why did I even bother?
