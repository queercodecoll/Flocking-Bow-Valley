(They/Them) [1/8]
0000:There's such a variety of interactions that you can have as a queer person, and, you know, maybe you've 
0005:experienced homophobia that day, maybe you're having just a bad day in general as people do, 
0010:and you don't want to be someone's gay Google to explain things to them and 
0015:you just don't have that energy today. Or being misgendered is just too much. You know, it's 
0020:like the more tics you have against you, the harder it can become to. You 
0025:know, just base certain reactions, and it's 
0030:interesting, I think, especially as a non-binary person to, I 
0035:guess, the difference between confusion 
0040:and assumptions to me as a non-binary person who's very fluid, if people are 
0045:confused and use a variety of pronouns or don't know what to say, I'm 
0050:usually not that offended. Usually, that is laughable when someone assumes that 
0055:I am a woman as someone who's clearly presenting 
0060:very neutrally to masculine. That's more hurtful. And it's like, why? 
0065:Also, where are you getting that? And I think a lot of the time people want to put 
0070:me in a box, that's man, woman, whatever it is. And I'm like, I'm not in 
0075:any of those boxes, just chilling around, floating around here in like the gender spectrum. 
0080:And I guess it's good for people 
0085:to know that if you don't know, you just don't need to gender anyone, 
0090:just you don't need to say, folks, you only just say anything, just say, "Hey, person, 
0095:you know, or like, Hey, do you want this? Do you need that? Is this what you ordered?" There's no 
0100:need to gender people if you don't know. And also, you don't maybe 
0105:need to know. In some interactions, it's really nice to ask someone what their pronouns are. In 
0110:some situations, it may be a bit weird that like, are you just if you're just 
0115:going to ask my pronouns at the table, then it's like, OK, that's odd. Unless you're asking 
0120:everyone their pronouns and telling us yours. In some situations, it makes sense to do 
0125:that, but other times, just leave it. You know, it's like, maybe you think it's more 
0130:polite to say yes or ma'am and something formal, but it's probably more polite if you just don't say anything at all.
