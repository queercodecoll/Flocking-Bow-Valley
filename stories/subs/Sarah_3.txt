0000:I come from a pretty large family every single three years we have like a family reunion.
0005:Growing up like I think there's like a hundred of us that all get together and it's very 
0010:church orientated because the entire family is religious. So it's basically 
0015:100 Mormons just running around discussing family gossip. 
0020:When I went back to Australia, I had come out 
0025:to my entire family. My parents thought 
0030:it was a good idea to write a big letter to everyone beforehand ahead of time. I 
0035:kind of wrote the letter and then they edited it to make sure that it kind of came across appropriately. 
0040:And that definitely upset me because I was like, these are my words. I kind of want to be the one doing it, but 
0045:I was just so over it at the time. I'm like, Whatever, just do it, deal with it. I don't care anymore. I 
0050:think they could tell that at that time, I was starting to get a little bit more aggressive about it. I'd gone 
0055:from hiding it to starting to do a lot more research 
0060:and getting angry about queer culture and the history and the fact that there was oppression. And, you 
0065:know, it was annoying. So I was starting to get a lot more vocal about it. And I don't think my 
0070:parents wanted me to cause a scene. That's kind 
0075:of how I see it, you know, and for them, it's even just a case of any 
0080:of my cousins. If they wanted to approach me and talk about it, then 
0085:the ball was in their court. But then when I went to the reunion, I had like a few cousins and whatnot 
0090:that were really cool and ended up like just basically giving me their full support. And I 
0095:also had cousins that refused to come up to me. My dad is a lot more open about everything now 
0100:and he very publicly 
0105:voted yes to gay marriage in Australia when my family was posting articles 
0110:on Facebook that what's next is we're going to have pedophiles running 
0115:the school system, you know, stuff like that. So I think my dad kind of realized like 
0120:microaggressions. It wasn't that my cousins were directly telling me what I was doing was wrong, but 
0125:them repetitively sharing things on Facebook, you know, that was very aggressive, 
0130:in my opinion. My dad kind of eventually was like, you know what, f### them. 
0135:I'm going to fight back now. But there is a degree of education that needs to be involved. And I 
0140:mean, it comes to a point where it's not that I'm shoving my gayness down your throat. It's 
0145:just literally education.
