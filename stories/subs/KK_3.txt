(They/Them) [3/8]
0000:Now that I more publicly talk about being non-binary, 
0005:my pronouns being they them, so all my friends are aware and 
0010:my partners. And primarily my friends are queer cis women. 
0015:And so I'll be out with the group of women. And then there's me. And so we 
0020:always get ladies. But now also that everyone around 
0025:me is so hyper-aware of it. Everyone is cringing. So 
0030:it's as a group, we're like, oh, and you could see everyone look each other to be like, "There it is 
0035:again." You know, why? Why do they have to do that every time? And 
0040:that's like, we have this awareness as a queer group of friends and because they know me, they know my gender, 
0045:my pronouns, whatever. But it's just like, itS's interesting then to see my cis 
0050:female friends being like, all right, here it comes. You 
0055:know. It's like no one wants that. No one wants anyone to be like mis-gendered, obviously. Like, 
0060:we're all here for each other. We're a good group of queer friends. And it's 
0W065:just a point that it just seems so unnecessary and that it's just like... It 
0070:just didn't need to happen. My guess, it's like an interesting thing when you're in like 
0075:a predominantly cis or straight space when you have these people who've 
0080:never had to question anything about themselves. And like, I can't relate 
0085:to that, you can't you don't understand why I'm upset about you misgendering me, but I can't relate to never 
0090:questioning anything about my sexuality, my gender, my expression. 
0095:That's horrifying to me, you know, like to me, it's a 
0100:struggle sometimes to find out who you are, to explore. Like, it's not easy. 
0105:But it would suck to just be like, this is 
0110:it? And like, I don't have any desire to grow or explore 
0115:something. It's just like, This is it? There's no question everything is made for me. So why 
0120:would I have to question anything? I go through things every space has made for me. I'm 
0125:not misgendered. Like, I know where to go for clothes. I know which section 
0130:to go to in H&M or whatever. There's like, you don't have to ask questions because. 
0135:Things just kind of were made for you or they work for you, and I'm like, that's 
0140:I'm sure it's nice, but also it sounds pretty boring.
