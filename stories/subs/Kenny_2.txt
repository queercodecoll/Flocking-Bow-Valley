0000:So we're, we are also having gay pride events now every year for the last three years, and
0005:we're having one this September. Our first gay pride, Morley Pride, was in
0010:2016, I believe. And then that was a huge turnout. Tickets were 
0015:sold out. Some elders came and gave blessing and then it was a parade. 
0020:And after the parade at 12, it starts. We have speakers, 
0025:and singers, and performers, and counsellors, and a few of us speaking of that event, 
0030:which has never, ever happened. It's a huge change from the 70s
0035:and 80s and 90s It's a breath of fresh air. You know, you 
0040:can express yourself and share 
0045:your lifestyle with the 
0050:community. You can express who you are openly and not be afraid of being condemned 
0055:or attacked. There are still homophobics out 
0060:there in the community, and a lot of mainstream Christians now still against it. 
0065:But you know, our message is about love, 
0070:unity, and respect, and service. You know, we 
0075:have two-spirited people community in the community working and serving people, and 
0080:we're contributing back to the community.
