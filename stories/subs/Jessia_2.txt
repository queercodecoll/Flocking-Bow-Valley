0000:I kind of had put together that, you know, like I am attractive to men, too. 
0005:And it just wasn't even a thought that it ever entered my head. Like I had always been 
0010:really guarded about my own attraction to men and like 
0015:not having to hide that being, you know, otherwise independent in Toronto. 
0020:I had a bit of a holy shit moment where I realized I didn't have to do that anymore. 
0025:There is no necessity beyond it all, like the, you know, fairly 
0030:unguarded conversations with my partner about our own sexuality and our own 
0035:kind of like, Oh, you know, you get to discussion about where are you, where you are with that? And she had 
0040:some queer leanings as well. So being, you know, completely on the other side, 
0045:I just completely broke down as soon as I felt like, Oh, other men are attracted to me too. 
0050:I just broke down in tears. It was. It was a whole thing. And 
0055:that's that's about when I came. That's when I came out to my 
0060:family. I think I would have been 23. It was at one of my 
0065:mother's birthday parties. And at that point, you know, like my 
0070:family has gone beyond being a struggling working 
0075:class family with a sick mum. You know, they're retired. They're otherwise 
0080:comfortable. My siblings have had kids. They've moved into, you know, kind 
0085:of comfortable middle and upper middle class lifestyles. So they 
0090:were mostly just kind of shrug and like, my mom was like, Yeah, that's fine. My dad gave me a 
0095:thumbs up, which is, yeah, 
0100:I don't know. It was about as agreeable as a coming at as you could hope. But like, 
0105:you know, it didn't really change much. I went back to my life in Toronto. They went back to their lives, you know,
0110:scattered across the region. And I'm 
0115:not sure if the rest is history, really, I guess, growing into comfort with being 
0120:a queer person. Now, I'm struggling for words at that part.
