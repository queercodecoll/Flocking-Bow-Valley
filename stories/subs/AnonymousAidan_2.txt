0000:I met this girl one time and she's interested in me, although 
0005:I've been explaining to her about my sexuality. And she can't wrap her 
0010:head around it. Although she would say that "no that's fine that's 
0015:cool, I have lots of queer friends." She says so she's very accepting of 
0020:it. But I guess I didn't know that like she's a bit frustrated... I 
0025:guess, for a bisexual male, guys, most 
0030:of them gay guys, do not believe me. They just think that I'm just trying to be masculine 
0035:or I don't know what it is that they're assuming of me. And 
0040:for females, what I find is that, yeah, they find it unattractive, 
0045:I guess, for at least most of the girls I met. And there's 
0050:this one girl that I met that's attracted to me… told me that bisexual 
0055:males do not exist. She said that it's rare, 
0060:like one out of like I can't remember her number. It's something exaggerated 
0065:like thousands of people can only be truly 
0070:male bisexual. That was hurtful. Because every day, 
0075:I already have to deal with this and then there's this one 
0080:person that's attracted to me, that basically tells me that 
0085:I don't exist. It just feels like I don't exist 
0090:anymore ‘cuz… like being told that you didn't exist here, 
0095:you know like your gender, your sexuality doesn't exist.
