0000:I was dating another fellow bisexual male who was in the closet. He's 
0005:not out and I'm not... I mean I'm not 
0010:denying that I'm not out either. But yeah this person, you know 
0015:we liked each other very much. But it got to a point where one 
0020:day he told me that he is seeing another girl. It was just 
0025:like a big surprise. It was a big shock to me. And then he told me 
0030:that no he doesn't see our future because he's not going to be in 
0035:a romantic relationship with a guy. I guess with his family 
0040:and stuff that's why he didn’t want to come out. It was really painful, 
0045:really heartbreaking. And he tells me, you 
0050:know, that he would marry me if he can. That’s how much 
0055:he loves me. But he said that he can't marry me because I'm a guy. 
0060:I’m still trying to wrap my head around that.
