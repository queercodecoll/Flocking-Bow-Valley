0000:Maybe I don't want to tell you anyway. Maybe I don't want to explain my 
0005:gender to you. I don't need to. And if you're cool with not knowing, that's 
0010:even better because I can just go exist as a person. As most 
0015:people get to do without being questioned, and that's like all I want to do, 
0020:I hate explaining stuff to people. I don't want to explain who I am because it feels like that I'm justifying that 
0025:as a non-binary person I exist when I do exist. So, just 
0030:let me be here. And I think it's interesting when 
0035:you contrast like the Bow Valley versus like a city, even Calgary, which is like, 
0040:obviously, we're in a conservative province, but 
0045:even in the valley, there's not a lot of queer spaces. There's like 
0050:a few restaurants, but it's really not that, you 
0055:know. Like when you go to the contrast of how often I get gendered and miss gendered 
0060:in the valley versus Calgary is I feel like pretty 
0065:extreme. And also when I'm going to Calgary, there's more spaces, so I'm going to go somewhere 
0070:probably that identifies as a queer-friendly or specifically a queer space. 
0075:And it goes from in the valley, in 
0080:small town, you know, being misgendered to not being 
0085:gendered at all is generally how it goes, and I'm like, "That's great. You 
0090:get that you don't need to get it." And I feel like it's like it comes down, maybe just to letting 
0095:queer people be.
