0000:One experience was when, because after my partner and I got together here 
0005:in Canada, I think it was a year, a year 
0010:and a half later. Yeah, I had to head back to finish my university degree in Australia. So 
0015:the plan was for me to come back for a year and a half. She was going to come to Australia for a 
0020:year and that year was during the plebiscite vote, which 
0025:was the Australian gay marriage vote. So it wasn't even like a binding 
0030:vote on the law. Basically, they sent out to everyone's 
0035:mail. You basically vote your mail that off and then the government gets the results in the end and 
0040:then the government then votes after that. It's non-binding, it's not legal. It's just 
0045:they want to get an idea of what the public thinks. But obviously during that time, there was lots 
0050:of media attention everywhere. It was when there was like a 
0055:major football game and like Macklemore was playing at it and he played "Same Love" and the 
0060:broadcaster decided to like at the very end of that, I think he had like a speech 
0065:about it, and the broadcaster decided to cut that out, and it caused lots of controversy. 
0070:And it was obviously the hot topic and me just coming out two years 
0075:ago. But in Canada, when it was a fresh start, it was new. I was very accepted here. Going 
0080:back to my family and my old friends was difficult. It was a bit of a shock to the system 
0085:to see how what their opinions were. And obviously, 
0090:as I just came out they said, "Well, what do you think about this?" And it was definitely draining having 
0095:to explain something that I guess I'd felt so comfortable in, in Canada 
0100:because it was legal here, for what, 10 years.
