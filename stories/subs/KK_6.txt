(They/Them) [6/8]
0000:Also, like when I think of like bigoted people or close-minded people, homophobic 
0005:people, whatever you want to call them, the way those 
0010:people look at you as a queer person or 
0015:queer presenting person, it's like, that they're allowed to look 
0020:almost through you. You know, where, like 
0025:normal people don't stare at strangers and hold eye contact when 
0030:you look back at them in the eyes. But when you're a queer 
0035:person, it's like, well, apparently I'm on display for some grandma on the bus who 
0040:I'm holding eye contact with and we'll stop staring at me or some homophobic jerks, 
0045:you know, it's like, why do you think you can look at me like this for this long? That's 
0050:not an acceptable thing to do, and that's not normal normally. Like if you stare at someone, if I was staring 
0055:at someone and they looked at me in the eye, I'd be like, Oh my god, oops. And I, you know, I'd look away. But 
0060:it's like. The look of I'm not only 
0065:looking at you like I'm watching you or something and you know what it's like 
0070:and I'm going to look back at you in the eyes and I'm not going to stop looking. I can do this. 
0075:Anyone as a minority can relate to people like 
0080:putting their opinion on why you should or should not be able to exist 
0085:or be here in a certain space. And like. Yeah, 
0090:like that, even when someone maybe is staring at you or talking to you. And 
0095:in a scary way, as a minority, you're like, I don't know, is this going to escalate? 
0100:Does this escalate to violence, to verbal harassment, 
0105:or is this person just going to stare through my soul and I'm probably going 
0110:to leave this space because I don't want, I don't feel safe, I don't want to be here like 
0115:I'm just trying to be. And they won't let me be.
