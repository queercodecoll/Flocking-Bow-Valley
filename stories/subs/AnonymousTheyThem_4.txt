0000:There's a lot of things with regards to the way people see me in terms of gender and
0005:sexuality that do frustrate me. There's that sense of not looking a certain way, and
0014:there's a lot of control that I don't have over my appearance. Like, I'm always going to
0019:be five foot one and have a fairly high pitched voice and, you know, not going to
0025:have the control that... I mean, my ideal would be that people would look at me and
0029:just not be able to tell what gender I am. And that sense of like, perfect androgyny is
0035:very much a pipe dream, which really frustrates me a lot.
0041:Yeah, it's a thing that I guess it's just part of life.
0046:Like, everyone has their hangups about their body. This is just... This is just a
0053:different one outside of what I think a lot of people have.
0060:And you can keep striving towards it, but there's always going to be someone, there's
0064:always going to be something. And that's not always what I want right now. I don't want to
0069:short hair. I did have it for a while. But like, you know, this is fine kind of fine the
0073:way it is because I'm having anxiety and I can, like, hide my face under it and, you
0076:know, I'm like wearing a dress right now because it's summer and it's nice. And, yeah,
0084:just stuff like that, you know? But then it's also. There is that other side of things,
0089:which like there are days when I'm dressed like more masculine and also feel like
0095:equally, equally nice. Yeah, it's kind of just the equilibrium of how I feel on the
0102:inside versus how I look on the outside, is just a constant source of slight tension and
0109:frustration, and the acceptance of it ebbs and flows. But it's always going to be a process.
