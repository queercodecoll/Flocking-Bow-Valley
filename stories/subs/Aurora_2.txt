Aurora
(She/Her) [2/5]
0000:One of the things about the open mic here is they are saying they're traditionally like all music. So 
0005:I've tried to avoid doing music. Just 
0010:because I always go first because I feel like that's my job till I break the stage 
0015:open a little bit for folks. And so, what have I done? The first 
0020:time I did like a weird, like performance art piece that's super weird. It was great. And 
0025:then the second one, there's only been two so far, I did, I 
0030:happened to find a bunch of pictures of myself over like six months when I was 18 years 
0035:old and I had not yet transitioned. And I was like cleaning the house 
0040:and whatever else. And there was this, like, I was that trans kid 
0045:that didn't really know she was trans. I mean, I knew that every problem, this 
0050:is I think the stupidest thing I've ever said in my life, but this is the true thought from the 
0055:thing, every problem I had would be solved if I had only been a girl slash woman, depending on how old I was. 
0060:But I also thought that was like just a normal thing. But everybody 
0065:thought that, obviously, and. So I found 
0070:I found this like six month, when I was 18, set of photos that had like a lot 
0075:of sort of like hilarious random things in common with them 
0080:and whatnot. And I did a slideshow of them up on stage and did like 
0085:an ode to past Aurora during this six months of time. And people 
0090:really liked it. So. It's also far enough away...
0095:So I'm 39 now and it's far enough away that. Like, 
0100:I don't want people to see photos of me when I was like 27. But
0105:I certainly don't mind people seeing photos of me when I was 18 because it doesn't 
0110:even feel like me. Like, that's not, that's a completely different human 
0115:right. So it's like this guy. I don't know who that guy 
0120:is, but. And so it's like, it's kind of easy to like, "It's so brave." And I was like, Honestly, it's not even me. So like.
