0000:So, I'm really fortunate that the community that I'm part 
0005:of in Twitch is really, like, it's really kind 
0010:and really nice and really thoughtful, and people are good people. 
0015:And so I really enjoy it when I'm like, OK, It's time to go live. Time to get 
0020:on stream. Time to play this game with my friends. Some of whom I've never actually met. And that's super fine. But 
0025:then today I was like, Also, I might get bombarded with 
0030:Nazis. Thanks for stealing that from me, Nazis for no 
0035:reason. So. You know. It's been around 
0040:on Twitch for a while, it's gotten very bad over the last week. One day they'll either do 
0045:something about it or not, right? And then it all, you know, like these things keep happening 
0050:where if Twitch doesn't do anything about it, then all the POC 
0055:and queer streamers will go to a different site. You see this happen like so much like all of these processes, 
0060:right? And then a site makes its name on, we'll 
0065:say traditionally other groups of people, and then the dominant culture comes 
0070:in, and now everybody's hearing this like it's really big and then Nazis start roaming it again 
0075:and they either do something about it or don't. And the cycle kind of continues, right? 
0080:Society marginalizes us, but then also wants to emulate and be like us all the time. 
0085:And then whatever "us" is always some kind of group of marginalization who does something cool 
0090:that they can't do, right? You know, it's the gay bar problem too, right? We're all the bachelorettes 
0095:were in gay bars, right? And then we have to go somewhere else because our bar is taken over by bachelorette 
0100:parties.
