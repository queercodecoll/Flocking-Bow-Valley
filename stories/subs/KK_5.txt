(They/Them) [5/8]
0000:I like that Calgary's is a smaller city like I've lived in Toronto, it's super gay, but  
0005:would have more services. I don't want to live in a big city and it sucks sometimes 
0010:that you have to like. Maybe where you want to be is not where like. You 
0015:can exist safely and happily as a queer person. 
0020:I was considering moving into a small town in inner B.C. or whatever, like, that's 
0025:somewhere I can maybe afford a funny little house. And 
0030:then I was like, no, actually, I can't go there, not where I'm at right now, 
0035:like with like newly being like transitioning and being on testosterone and in 
0040:like exploring more like being non-binary like I can, I definitely cannot exist 
0045:in those spaces. So it's like just even the fact that. When 
0050:it's traveling, you're moving as a queer person, you have to search if that's somewhere that's OK to be. 
0055:Like straight people don't have to do that, you're also shooting straight-friendly vacation 
0060:destinations. That's everything. It's 
0065:like why, why as a queer person if I want to have a yard in the garden, 
0070:I then have to deal with maybe being hate crimed. I 
0075:just want to grow some vegetables. Why, like, why can 
0080:I not live in a place where I can afford to have a garden while also 
0085:having people that accept me, which is like 
0090:bare minimum or they just don't want to harm me. Like, forget that there's even community 
0095:there, you know, like that is such a low bar. And. 
0100:That's why I think poor people end up in the city, but then it's like, this is maybe, but also I 
0105:do want to just relax and it's everything is a rush here. I just want to hang out on the 
0110:porch after work. I don't want to have to commute two hours on the subway or the 
0115:streetcar, the bus, whatever it is. I was like, Well, this is where I'm allowed to exist and 
0120:this is where I can safely exist and be safe and also have community.
